# Visualizing Machine Learning
### How to build an interactive Plotly dashboard for your classification model

This repository involves building a simple K-Nearest Neighbors classifier using the Iris dataset and scikit learn, and then visualizing the results with [Plotly Dash](https://plot.ly/dash). The lecture is intended for students with some introductory knowledge of data science (i.e., you understand simple classification and can read a confusion matrix).

* You can view the finished app [here](https://knn-iris-classifier.herokuapp.com/).

* Note that Plotly dash apps are best viewed in a modern browser like Mozilla or Chrome.
